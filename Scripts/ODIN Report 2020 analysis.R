#### Analysis ####
# Start with shorter general discussion of scores by categories for 
# 2020 and trends since 2016. Are certain coverage or openness lacking 
# in certain categories more than others? Can do something similar to 
# previous yearâ€™s report. (Lorenz) 

# Replicate 2020 and 2018 part of Figure 2 from ODIN 2020/2021 Executive Summary

# Health section- Focus on scores from the 3 health categories, 
# identify trends or interesting findings from 2020. Bring in Global 
# Health 50/50 COVID data or other COVID related data (Lorenz) 

# Economic section- Focus on gaps in economic and financial statistics. 
# What categories are lacking? Are there certain coverage or openness 
# elements that are lower across categories? Do SDDS, SDDS+ countries 
# score higher? (Lorenz)
